/// Represents an immutable RDF graph with triple pattern matching capabilities
///
/// An RDF graph is formally defined as a set of RDF triples. This class provides
/// functionality for working with such graphs, including:
/// - Creating graphs from sets of triples
/// - Adding or removing triples (creating new graph instances)
/// - Merging graphs
/// - Querying triples based on patterns
///
/// The class is designed to be immutable for thread safety and to prevent
/// accidental modification. All operations that would modify the graph
/// return a new instance.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Create a graph with some initial triples
/// final graph = RdfGraph(triples: [
///   Triple(john, name, johnSmith),
///   Triple(john, knows, jane)
/// ]);
///
/// // Create a new graph with an additional triple
/// final updatedGraph = graph.withTriple(Triple(jane, name, janeSmith));
/// ```
final class RdfGraph {
  /// All triples in this graph
  final List<Triple> _triples;

  /// Creates an immutable RDF graph from a list of triples
  ///
  /// The constructor makes a defensive copy of the provided triples list
  /// to ensure immutability. The graph can be initialized with an empty
  /// list to create an empty graph.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// // Empty graph
  /// final emptyGraph = RdfGraph();
  ///
  /// // Graph with initial triples
  /// final graph = RdfGraph(triples: myTriples);
  /// ```
  RdfGraph({List<Triple> triples = const []})
    : _triples = List.unmodifiable(List.from(triples));

  /// Creates an RDF graph from a list of triples (factory constructor)
  ///
  /// This is a convenience factory method equivalent to the default constructor.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final graph = RdfGraph.fromTriples(myTriples);
  /// ```

  /// Creates a new graph with the specified triple added
  ///
  /// Since RdfGraph is immutable, this returns a new instance with
  /// all the existing triples plus the new one. The original graph
  /// remains unchanged.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// // Add a statement that John has email john@example.com
  /// final newGraph = graph.withTriple(
  ///   Triple(john, email, LiteralTerm.string('john@example.com'))
  /// );
  /// ```

  /// @param triple The triple to add to the graph
  /// @return A new graph instance with the added triple

  ///
  /// Since RdfGraph is immutable, this returns a new instance with
  /// all existing and new triples. The original graph remains unchanged.

  /// // Add multiple statements about Jane
  /// final newGraph = graph.withTriples([
  ///   Triple(jane, email, LiteralTerm.string('jane@example.com')),
  ///   Triple(jane, age, LiteralTerm.typed('28', 'integer'))
